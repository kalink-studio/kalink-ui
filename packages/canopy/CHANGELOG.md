# @kalink-ui/canopy

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1efa841: Harden test suites (Vitest v4, Playwright, Storybook) and improve accessibility.

  Breaking changes (still released as `minor` because we are in `0.x`):
  - `@kalink-ui/seedly`: `ButtonIcon` now requires a `label` prop for accessibility.
    - Migration: replace `aria-label="..."` with `label="..."` on `ButtonIcon`.
    - Icon children are treated as decorative (`aria-hidden`) and the label is announced via visually-hidden text.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 8ec0736: Fix typing issues and tooling configuration
